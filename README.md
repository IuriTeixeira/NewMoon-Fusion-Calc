## New Moon Fusion Tool

This is a simple fusion tool for the New Moon server of the Shin Megami Tensei: IMAGINE Online MMO.

I made this mostly because the regular [imagine fusion tool](https://aqiu384.github.io/megaten-fusion-tool/smtim/demons) is made for a vanilla server and doesn't include the new demons from New Moon, and it uses localized names that are not reflected in-game, which makes working with it a bit annoying in some cases. Additionally, I noticed some fusion ranges were wrong in that tool, which I have corrected on this.

This was made from scratch, I have not used any code from aqiu384's tool. All the information used to make this came from the imagine wiki, myself checking things in-game, and some people helping out with things I couldn't check myself.

The purpose of this tool is simply to facilitate fusions. As such, I haven't included any information that is not related to fusions, such as stats, affinities, skills, etc.

I do not plan on implementing regular triple fusions on this tool. You should not use those unless you're fusing a demon that requires it in the first place, in which case you don't need a fusion tool.
